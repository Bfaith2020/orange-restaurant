## JavaScript Effects

### Smoke Effect (Homepage)

The smoke effect is created using JavaScript. It generates animated smoke particles that float up from the bottom of the screen, creating an atmospheric effect.

### Menu Sliding Effect (Menu Page)

The menu sections on the Menu page use the Intersection Observer API to create a sliding effect. As you scroll down the page, each menu section smoothly slides into view when it enters the viewport.
